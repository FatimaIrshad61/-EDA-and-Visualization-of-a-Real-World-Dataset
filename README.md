## Steps in the Project

### 1. Load the Dataset
- Use `pandas` to load the dataset.
- Explore the data structure, dimensions, and summary statistics to understand its contents.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Handle Missing Values**: Imputed missing values where applicable or removed rows/columns with excessive null values.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Ensured unique entries by dropping duplicate rows.
- **Identify and Manage Outliers**:
  - Used statistical methods (e.g., Z-scores, IQR) and visualizations to detect outliers.
  - Addressed outliers by capping or removing them, depending on the scenario.

### 3. Visualizations
- **Bar Charts**: Generated for categorical variables to show frequency distributions.
- **Histograms**: Plotted for numerical variables to understand their distributions.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Created to identify relationships between numeric features.
